A program to visualize the following 3 basic sorting algorithms:
    Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, & Shellsort

C++, project created in Code::Blocks.
The entire program is rendered using the SDL and SDL extension libraries.

Towards the end of the project I realized a proper GUI developed using 
somehing like Qt would be easier to render and add features to. A possible
future project.
